        {
          "question": "Is there a cost to mint?",
          "answer": "Yes, but it's minimal. The Solana network charges a small 'Rent' fee to store your data. Additionally, Nexus charges a flat 0.02 SOL service fee. Total required: ~0.03-0.04 SOL."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are these real tokens?",
          "answer": "Yes, 100%. You are minting official SPL Tokens on the Solana Blockchain. <br/><br/> <strong>Important:</strong> For your token to have a price, you must list it on a DEX like <strong>Raydium</strong> and add Liquidity after minting."
        },
        {
          "question": "I'm a beginner. How do I start?",
          "answer": "1. Install Phantom Wallet. 2. Buy some SOL. 3. Connect your wallet here. 4. Fill the form and click Mint. Done!"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you have access to my wallet?",
          "answer": "No. Nexus is a decentralized application (Dapp). We don't have a database and cannot access your funds or keys. Transactions happen directly between you and the blockchain."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where is the image stored?",
          "answer": "Your token image is permanently stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) via Pinata. It cannot be deleted or censored."
        },
        {
          "question": "Who controls the Authority?",
          "answer": "You do. By default, both Mint and Freeze Authorities are assigned to your wallet. You have absolute ownership. You can Revoke these authorities later if needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why Solana instead of Ethereum?",
          "answer": "Speed and Cost. Minting on Ethereum can cost $50+. On Solana, it's cents. This is why Solana is the home of Meme Coins."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I list on Raydium?",
          "answer": "After minting here, go to Raydium.io -> Liquidity -> Create Pool. Select your token and pair it with SOL (e.g., 100M tokens + 5 SOL). This creates a market for people to buy."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I update the name/image later?",
          "answer": "Yes. Nexus tokens adhere to the Metaplex standard with `isMutable: true`. You can update metadata using token management tools, as long as you haven't revoked the update authority."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there geographic restrictions?",
          "answer": "No. The blockchain knows no borders. Your wallet is your identity. Nexus is available to everyone, globally."
